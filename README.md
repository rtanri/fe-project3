## Our FrontEnd

- Using Material UI, React-cookie, React Toastify, and React Credit Cards

## Our BackEnd

- Consist of 6 collections in MongoDB
- Build with 21 routes controllers to fully manage webapp.

## Libraries used

- Multer
- Checkvalidator
- Bcrypt
- Cloudinary
- GoogleAPI

## Challenges that we encounter

- Not used to code BE/FE only, for example, while coding BE there are some logic that hard to imagine without frontend flow. For FE, keep editing and adding schemas on building web-app flow,
- Wrap the repetitive code with in functions to prevent lengthy code,
- Need some time to learn using React-hook (useParams, useHistory, useEffect),
- JWT errors took some time but it only require us to clear cache in browser and it took us abit of time to connect the JWT to the front end
