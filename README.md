# Frontend Project 3 - [Live Demo](https://freshstart-deployment.herokuapp.com/)

Git repo for Project 3 General Assembly. Mainly build with react app.

# Planning and Preparation

- UI/UX with Figma
- Task delegation with Notion, each card contain UX based task
- Plan number of collections, schema content

# Our FrontEnd

- Build with 100% React Functional-Hook based
- Consist of 9 pages and 2 additional components (Navbar and Footer)
- Using Material UI, React-cookie, React Toastify, and React Credit Cards

# Our BackEnd

- Seamless backend file storage with Cloudinary
- Consist of 6 collections in MongoDB
- Build with 21 routes controllers to fully manage webapp.

# Challenges that we encounter

- Since we are still unsure on user experience, we keep editing schema and router-controller to match the user-interaction,
- Need some time to learn using React-hook (useParams, useHistory, useEffect)
- JWT errors that require us to clear cache and cookies in browser
